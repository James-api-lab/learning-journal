# 🧱 Week 5 Learning Journal — Flask CRUD + Persistence
*Learning APIs Project*

---

## 🗓 Week Overview
**Goal:** Learn how APIs store, read, update, and delete data using Flask + SQLite + SQLAlchemy.

---

## 🧩 Day 1 — Persistence Foundations
**Focus:** What does “saving data” actually mean?

**What I did**
- Created project folder and virtual env  
- Installed Flask, SQLAlchemy, dotenv, pytest  
- Verified `/health` route  
- Fixed SQLite path errors with absolute path logic  

**What I learned**
- Persistence = data living beyond a single run  
- ORMs translate Python ↔ SQL so you don’t write raw queries  
- `commit()` makes data permanent  

**Challenges**
- “Unable to open database file” → fixed via `config.py` path builder  
- PowerShell curl alias confusion  

**Next Step**
- Implement Create + Read routes tomorrow
