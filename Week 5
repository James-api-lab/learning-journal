# 🧱 Week 5 Learning Journal — Flask CRUD + Persistence
*Learning APIs Project*

---

## 🗓 Week Overview
**Goal:** Learn how APIs store, read, update, and delete data using Flask + SQLite + SQLAlchemy.

---

## 🧩 Day 1 — Persistence Foundations
**Focus:** What does “saving data” actually mean?

**What I did**
- Created project folder and virtual env  
- Installed Flask, SQLAlchemy, dotenv, pytest  
- Verified `/health` route  
- Fixed SQLite path errors with absolute path logic  

**What I learned**
- Persistence = data living beyond a single run  
- ORMs translate Python ↔ SQL so you don’t write raw queries  
- `commit()` makes data permanent  

**Challenges**
- “Unable to open database file” → fixed via `config.py` path builder  
- PowerShell curl alias confusion  

**Next Step**
- Implement Create + Read routes tomorrow

## 🧩 Day 2 — Create + Read Deep Dive

**Focus:** Adding validation and data integrity to the API.

**What I did**
- Enhanced `/records` POST to validate input fields (`city`, `temp`, `humidity`).
- Added consistent JSON error responses for invalid data.
- Tested different POST scenarios in PowerShell using `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Invoke-RestMethod`.

**What I learned**
- Validation is what separates hobby projects from production code.
- PowerShell and `curl.exe` handle JSON quoting differently — an important cross-platform lesson.
- Error responses should be predictable (always JSON, always include an `error` key).

**Challenges**
- Frustration with JSON quoting and `curl` syntax.
- Understanding why Flask rejected certain requests helped clarify how request bodies are parsed.
- The learning felt slow, but it reinforced core API behaviors (status codes, contracts).

**Next Step**
- Implement `PUT` and `DELETE` routes to complete the CRUD cycle.
- Add safeguards so updates and deletions are intentional and confirmed.

**Mood Check**
Slightly underwhelmed today — this part feels repetitive, but it’s the groundwork for professional-grade APIs. I’m getting more confident with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and structured testing.
