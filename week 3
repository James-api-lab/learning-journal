# Week 3 – Day 1
I set up my first Node.js project with pnpm, confirmed I can load my API key from .env, and built scripts to fetch weather data. I started with one city, then looped through multiple, and finished by adding CLI flags with yargs. 
This feels like the JavaScript mirror of what I did in Python last week.

accomplished for W3D1

✅ Installed Node.js & pnpm
✅ Initialized a Node project
✅ Verified .env works with your OpenWeather key
✅ Wrote and ran JavaScript scripts:

weather_one_city.js → fetch 1 city’s weather
weather_variations.js → loop through multiple cities
weather_flags.js → pass cities from the CLI, control units with a flag (and .env default)

✅ Pushed everything to GitHub under API-Lab org

I will admit, I am lost with the node.js language. I really struggled understanding what was going here.
