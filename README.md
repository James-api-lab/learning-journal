built a working Morning Brief generator in Python.
Pulls Seattle weather (Open-Meteo API)
Fetches top Seattle + world headlines (NewsAPI)
Uses OpenAI to generate a short banking/markets summary
Formats everything into an HTML email
Sends it automatically via SendGrid with an API (delivers to spam right now)
